# Project Vendor
Our project is a role-based web application built with Django and React, designed for a university setting where students and vendors interact. The application enables users to register as either a student or a vendor. Students can place job offers, while vendors can browse events and accept offers. Our website also facilitates discussions and negotiations between both parties. The app also allows vendors to upload and manage items in their inventories as sales happen during the event. 
This project was created as part of NUS' Orbital Apollo 11 program. 

## Motivation 
There are many CCAs and societies in NUS that hold fundraisers to raise money for their CCAs, projects and causes. Oftentimes, they call down small local vendors to sell their items. The relationship between these two parties are symbiotic as these NUS based CCAs offer the vendors a chance to sell their items while the vendors help the students to raise money. However, there seems to be a lack of a centralised platform for both parties to connect with one another as they are unaware of each otherâ€™s existence. As a result, these student groups often spam many of these vendors DMs on social media platforms. With a more centralised platform like ours, they could essentially save the time spent chasing these vendors.  During the fundraisers, inventory management and revenue sharing becomes a very tricky affair. Whilst excel sheets can be used, nothing beats a human-friendly UI that is also able to automate some transactions. 

## User Stories 
- As a student group who wants to attract vendors for their fundraisers, they will be able to post descriptions of their upcoming fundraisers or accept the requests of vendors seeking to sell items.
- As a vendor who wants to have a crowd to sell to, they will be able to request for a job or accept the request for vendors for a fundraiser hosted by a student group, as well as manage product sales.

## Uniqueness of our app
There are many apps out there that aim to bring buyers and sellers together such as Carousell and Ebay. However, these apps target one-off transactions. More importantly, this app hopes to bring (student) organizations and small vendors together, both of whom lack the clout and resources to seek opportunities for themselves. The app also aims to double up as an inventory management system during the fundraisers themselves.
